# Adding annotations to an image

## Introduction

This guide will help you to get started with the process of adding annotations to images.

The steps of adding an annotation consist of the following:

1. Adding a polygon to an image
2. Describing the selected polygon (i.e. a class and collection of attributes that this region satisfies)

You may repeat the steps above as many times as necessary to indicate all objects of interest on the image.

## Adding an annotation to an image

To select a region of an image you need to

1. Select a polygon tool from the toolbar on the left side of the screen

2. Left-click on the image to add points

**HINT:** you can use Ctrl+Z to remove an accidentally added point. Similarly, press Ctrl+Shift+Z to re-add a previously removed point.

**HINT:** right-click on the image to cancel the current polygon.

3. Once you are done contouring an object on the image, close the polygon by clicking on the start point. The polygon will be added to the image.

4. The just-added polygon will automatically become selected so that you can describe it (i.e. assign a class and configure attributes).

5. Now in the panel on the right assign a class and configure attributes

6. You can edit these parameters later by selecting a polygon of interest by clicking on it.

**HINT:** you can delete selected polygon by pressing a DELETE or a BACKSPACE key.
