## Project Description
LabelThem is an online markup tool aimed at building image datasets for computer vision research, 
and integrated with [Yandex.Toloka crowdsourcing system](https://toloka.yandex.ru/).

With *LabelThem* you can quickly get a markup, with classes and parameters of objects you are interested in, 
by providing images, lists of classes and parameters of objects, and, if you don't have the resources to label 
images by yourself, a short description of which types of objects you are interested in, and money to reward 
Mechanical Turks for performed markup.

## Important Notice
At the moment *LabelThem* works  only with [Yandex.Toloka crowdsourcing system](https://toloka.yandex.ru/) in 
[Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/Home) and [Chrome](https://www.google.ru/chrome) web browsers.
