Issues reported on on [the project's repository issues page](https://github.com/innosoft-pro/label-them/issues) can have one or more of the following labels: “delighter”, “enhancement”, “question”, “bug”, “critical”, “duplicate”, “help wanted”, “invalid”, “wontfix”, and “To be tested and closed”.

Issues marked with the “delighter” label are of low priority to the reposotory maintainers (innosoft-pro).

“question”, “bug”, and “enhancement” are the types of issues. 

If the issues is marked with “question” label it means that the issue is more of a question than a request for new features or a report of broken features, but can sometimes lead to further discussion or changes of confusing or incongruous behavior or documentation.
“Enhancement” issues describe points that can be improved in the way the system works at the moment of their report.  
“Bug” issues documents broken, incorrect, or confusing behavior.

“critical” label points out the higher priority of the issue for innosoft-pro.

“Duplicate” label points out that the issue is a duplicate of another reported issue.

Issues with “help wanted” label appears to have a simple solution. Issues having this label should be a good starting place for new contributors to LabelThem.

“Invalid” issues have been reviewed by a LabelThem developer, but they cannot be replicated even after the context specification.

“Wontfix” label states that the issue is legitimate, but it is not something the LabelThem community is currently able or willing to fix or implement. Issues having this label may be revisited in the future.

As the development community made necessary actions and considers the issue as resolved in the latest version of the system in develop-toloka branch, they describe the solution (if needed) in the comment for the issue, and label the issue as “To be tested and closed”.

innosoft-pro representatives check all issues with this tag and test their resolution on their local machines, and if they are satisfied with the result, they close the issue. If not, they comment on what points should still be improved and remove “To be tested and closed” tag from the issue.
